# tri_dislocations_python

`tri_dislocations_python` (or `tde`) is a uncreatively-named port of Brendan
Meade's [tde][tde_bjm] MATLAB code for generating displacements, strains and
stresses from a triangular dislocation within an elastic halfspace. The
algorithms developed by Meade are written about in Meade (2007): "Algorithms
for the calculation of exact displacements, strains, and stresses for
triangular dislocation elements in a uniform elastic half space", *Computers &
Geosciences*.

The Python code here is only minimally modified from the MATLAB source. The
biggest changes are in making a central `tde` module with routines common
to both strain and displacement calculations, and moving the nitty gritty
strain and displacement functions to their own files, which are called by
`tde` routines.

Also, line breaks.

The code is not exhaustively tested but seems to match the results produced by
the MATLAB code (run in Octave) to the expected precision following ~50,000
sequential arithmetic operations on floats (i.e., still good enough for earth
science).


## Usage

### Installation

`tde` only requires `numpy` and the standard Python library. It is tested on
Python 3.4 but should run on any system. It optionally uses `cython` which
greatly increases the speed of many of the strain calculations.

#### Building Cython files
run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` in the outer `tri_dislocations_python`
directory.


### Installation

Run `python setup.py install` in the outer `tri_dislocations_python` directory
to install it system-wide. 

All the real code is in the `tde` folder. If system-wide installation is not
desired, copy that folder to the desired directory or temporarily add it to
the `$PYTHONPATH` or with `sys.path.append`.


### Usage

To calculate displacements, run
```python
import tde

U = tde.calc_tri_displacements(sx, sx, sz, x, y, z, pr, ss, ts, ds)
```
where `sx, sy, sz` are the 'station' coordinates or coordinates where the
calculations are to be made, `x, y, z` are arrays of the (x,y,z) coordinates
of the triangular dislocation's vertices, `pr` is the Poisson ratio, and
`ss, ts, ds` are the strike-slip displacement, tensile displacement, and
dip-slip displacement. `U` will be returned as a `dict` with `x`, `y`, and `z`
fields with those displacements for each station.

Similarly, strain is calculated as
```python
E = tde.calc_tri_strains(sx, sx, sz, x, y, z, pr, ss, ts, ds)
```
`E` here is a dict with each of the strain components.

Stress is calculated using `S` and material parameters:
```python
S = tde.strain_to_stress(E, lamda, mu)
```
`lamda` (NOT `lambda` which is a Python keyword) and `mu` are the Lame's
constants.


## In the Year 2000

The code is (likely) as functional as its source right now. Currently, a few
enhancements are planned:

- [ ] Optimization using [`numexpr`][numexpr] or [`numba`][numba], if those are
      installed on the user's system.

- [ ] Utilities for automatically running a collection of triangular
      displacements.
